This is the "professional" version of [ikuda.net](https://ikuda.net/). It's a little experiment of mine, to try to make a website that looks more professional / a more professional ikuda.net. It uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [this useful script](https://css-tricks.com/prevent-white-flash-iframe/) that prevents the icons from flashing white when loading. (Yes, unfortunately the social icons are an iframe.)
