This is the "professional" version of [ikuda.net](https://ikuda.net/). It's a little experiment of mine, to try to make a website that looks more professional / a more professional ikuda.net. It uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [this useful script](https://css-tricks.com/prevent-white-flash-iframe/) that prevents the icons from flashing white when loading. (Yes, unfortunately the social icons are an iframe.)

The logo / branding (whatever you want to call it) was made by me. I made a gradient using CSS, screenshotted it, put it in GIMP along with the text underneath it. I then used one of the filters (i can't remember the name right now) to get the gradient on the text.

**Addendum: This version will never replace ikuda.net. It is a seperate project, and an experiment.**
